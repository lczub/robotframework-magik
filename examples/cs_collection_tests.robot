*** Test Cases ***
Test example - Get coordinate_system collection
    ${coll_cs}=    Get DsCollection    sw_gis!coordinate_system

Test example - Get coordinate_system record wgs84
    ${a_cs_rec}=    Get Record With Predicate    sw_gis!coordinate_system    predicate.wild(:name, "*longlat_wgs84*")
    ${cs_name}=    Execute Magik Command    ${a_cs_rec}.name
    Should Contain    ${cs_name}    world_longlat_wgs84_degree
    ${cs_id}=    Execute Magik Command    ${a_cs_rec}.abbrev
    Should Contain    ${cs_id}    EPSG:4326
